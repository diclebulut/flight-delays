# flight-delays

June 2025 

This project is leveraging machine learning models to predict flight delays, using The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics's data that tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015 and the aircraft tail and model information recorded by the Aircraft Parking System at SFO.


The main data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays , subjected to CC0: Public Domain Licence. 
The tail number - model mapping data comes from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/aircraft-tail-numbers-and-models-at-sfo (This dataset is also intended for public access and use).
